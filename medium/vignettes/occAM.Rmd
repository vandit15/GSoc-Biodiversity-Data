This function takes as parameters-

1. The country in ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 format(two charaters to represent a particular country).

2. Key for selecting the class of species (an integer defined accordingly by GBIF).

3. A logical value(TRUE/FALSE) as to whether user wants complete details and large output with all fields.

This function uses the rgbif and the rgeospatialquality packages to extract data and then to apply the Geospatial Quality API respectively (applying format_gq function).

```{r output}
  library(medium)
  occ <- occAM()
  str(occ)
```


The parameters have default values to get the occurence data of Australian mammals, but other values can be given to the parameters to search accordingly.
